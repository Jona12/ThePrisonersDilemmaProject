# ThePrisonersDilemmaProject

[this is a work in progress as part of my final year project, a LOT more to follow]

Java application recreating Axelrod's Prisoners Dilemma Tournament.

### Features
- Customise variables in the Tournament (e.g. change number of rounds, disable the use of the RANDOM strategy)
- Create your own strategies to compete against the original strategies that were in Axelrod's Tournament using:
  - simple drop-down style interface
  - or producing your own Java code in run-time
- Export .csv tournament results
- Analyse tournament results, and compare results of two tournaments
